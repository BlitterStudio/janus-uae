make_hdf
========

make_hdf is a command-line tool for creating unformatted hard disk
images (hard files) for PUAE (and other versions of UAE). It will
also print a config option that can be added to a UAE config file to
mount the created disk image.

Usage
-----

make_hdf accepts the following parameters:

make_hdf <path> <size> [<device>]

<path>   The path to the file to create. Note that any directories 
         included in this path must already exist; make_hdf will not
         create them for you.
       
<size>   The size of the hard disk image to create in MB. Add a trailing
         'G' to the size to specify a size in GB or a 'K' for a size
         in KB.

<device> Device name to be included in the generated config option.
         This is optional and defaults to DH0: if omitted.

Example
-------

> make_hdf hdf/my_disk.hdf 2G DH5:

Will generate a 1 GB disk as the file 'hdf/my_disk.hdf' and the
following config options are output (see configuration.txt).

hardfile2=rw,DH5:hdf/my_disk.hdf,32,2,2,512,0,
hardfile=rw,32,2,2,512,hdf/my_disk.hdf


Limits
------

On systems that do not support large files sizes (i.e, systems without
support for 64-bit file sizes), make_hdf is limited to creating hard
files up to 2GB in size.

On systems that do support large file sizes, make_hdf can create hard
files up to around 2TB in size (whether you can make use of disks that
in AmigaOS is another question).

Sparse files
------------

Where supported (e.g., Linux, MacOS X), make_hdf will create sparse
files. This allows hard disk images which are not full to take up less
space on disk.
