Floppy drive emulation
======================

E-UAE emulates up to four floppy drives. Standard PC floppy drives cannot
read Amiga floppies, so floppy disks are currently supported as image files
(support for Catweasel hardware, a floppy controller which can read Amiga
floppies - and other unusual disk formats - will be added in a future
version).

E-UAE supports a number of floppy image formats, optionally compressed by
gzip or packed inside a Zip archive.

ADF
---

The classic floppy image format for UAE, a plain raw image of the disk's
formatted contents.


DMS
---

DMS was a popular disk image cruncher. E-UAE can transparently read DMS
images.


FDI
---

FDI is a floppy image format used by the Disk2FDI tool. See
http://www.oldskool.org/disk2fdi.


IPF
---

IPF is the floppy image format employed by the CAPS project (see
http://caps-project.org/). A suitable plug-in, downloadble from the CAPS web
site, must be installed on the host system to allow IPF images to be used.
(At the time of writing, the plug-in is available for only x86 and PPC Linux
hosts and AmigaOS hosts.)


Creating blank ADF images
=========================

On Unix-like platforms, a blank floppy image can be created as follows. To
create a standard 3.5" DD image, use:

dd if=/dev/zero of=blank.adf count=1760

To create a 3.5" HD image, use:

dd if=/dev/zero of=blank.adf count=3520
