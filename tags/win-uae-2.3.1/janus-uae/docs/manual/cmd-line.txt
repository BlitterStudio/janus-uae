Command line options for E-UAE
==============================

E-UAE supports the following command-line options. Note that, where
applicable, these will over-ride any similar options specified in the
default configuration file.

In the following, <path> should be substituted with an appropriate file path
and <n> with an integer.

This document (like the rest of the documentation) is a work-in-progress.


-h
 Displays summary of configuration options.


-f <path>
 Load the configuration file specified by <path>. See configuration.txt for
 more information about configuration files. For example:

 -f ~/my_uae_configs/a1200.uaerc


-s <option>
 Specify an option in configuration file (<key>=<value>) format. For
 example, use 
 
 -s ntsc=true
 
 to start E-UAE in NTSC mode.
 
 See configuration.txt for supported options.
 

-0 <path>
-1 <path>
-2 <path>
-3 <path>
 Mount the floppy disk image specified by <path> in drive 0/1/2/3. For
 example:

 -0 somedisk.adf


-r <path>
 Load the ROM image specified by <path>.


-K <path>
 Use the key file specified by <path> to decrypt an encrypted ROM image (from
 Cloanto's AmigaForever package).


-C<n>
 Selects type of CPU to emulate. The value <n> corresponds to CPU types as
 follows:
 0: 6800
 1: 68010
 2: 68020
 3: 68020/68881
 4: 68040


-w<n>
 Selects the performance model for the CPU emulation.

 A value of 0 for <n> corresponds to 'real' CPU speed, that is,
 approximately A500 speed; a value of -1 corresponds to the 'max' CPU speed,
 that is, the emulation will run as fast as your system allows. A positive
 value for <n> will select 'adjustable' CPU speed, where <n> specifies the
 number of virtual emulator cycles that each CPU instructions will take and
 can be between 1 and 5120. (Positive values for <n> correspond to the same
 values specified with the 'finegrain_cpu_speed=' configuration option).


-v<n>
 Selects the type of Amiga chip set to emulate. The value <n> corresponds to
 chip set types as follows:

 0: OCS
 1: OCS but with the ECS or "Fat" Agnus.
 3: ECS
 4: AGA


-c<n>
 Emulate <n> * 512 KB of Chip memory. The valid  range of values for <n> is
 from 1 to 16, which corresponds to 512 KB to 8 MB of Chip memory. For example:

 -c4

 will cause E-UAE to emulate 2 MB of Chip memory.


-b<n>
 Emulate <n> * 256 KB of Slow memory. Valid values for <n>  include 0, 2, 4
 and 6, which corresponds to 0 KB, 512 KB, 1 MB and 1.5 MB, respectively.


-F<n>
 Emulate <n> MB of ZorroII Fast memory. A maximum of 8 MB is supported.


-Z<n>
 Emulate <n> MB of ZorroIII Fast memory. A maximum of 512 MB is supported.


-U<n>
 Emulate <n> MB of video memory on the virtual Picasso96 graphics card.
 Selecting <n>  greater than 0, enables the Picasso96 emulation, and a maximum
 of 32 MB of video memory may be emulated.


-m/M
 Use filesystem as Amiga volume, arguments are: access,'Amiga
 volume-name':'host directory path' - where 'access' can be 'read-only' or
 'read-write'

-W
 Hardfile specifications, arguments are: access, sectors, surfaces,
 reserved, blocksize, path format

-S
 parse_sound_spec

-R
 frame-skip rate, between 1 and 20

-i
 print illegal memory access by Amiga software?

-J
 joystick: Use -J xy, where x and y can be 0 for joystick 0, 1 for joystick
 1, M for mouse, and a, b or c for different keyboard settings.

-t
 test drawing speed

-G
 disable GUI and goes straight to emulator

-D
 Enable the debugger

-n
 Perform blits immediately, 0: disable, 1: enable

-l
 keyboard language: (possible arguments: de, dk, us, se, fr, it, es)

-O
 The format to use is: "width:height:modifiers", where modifiers are: l:
 Treat display as lo-res, x: Center display horizontally, y: Center display
 vertically, d: double line, a: fullscreen Amiga, p: fullscreen Picasso96,
 c: Correct aspect ratio

-H
 color_mode, or amiga_screen_type (if compiled with Amiga GFX support)


Options specific to the X11 graphics driver
===========================================

-L
 Use "low-bandwidth" mode, which may reduce the amount of data transferred
 between E-UAE and the X server. That's particularly an advantage when these
 are running on two different machines in a network.

-T
 Use the MIT-SHM extension. This may not be available on all machines, and
 it will not work if E-UAE and the X server are not running on the same
 machine. In all other configurations, turning on this option will give you
 a huge speed improvement.

-x
 Turn off the X11 mouse cursor.


Options specific to the AmigaOS graphics driver
===============================================

-T
 If using a palette-mapped display (256 colours or fewer), render the output
 in grey-scale rather than colour.

-x
 If using a palette-mapped display (256 colours or fewer), don't dither the
 output.


Options specific to the Curses graphics driver
==============================================

-x
 Enable reverse video.
