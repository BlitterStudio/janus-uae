Networking
==========

The Amiga environment running within UAE may share the host machine's
network access via an emulation of the bsdsocket.library (this library
provides the standard Amiga networking API). This isn't supported on
all target platforms yet, but it should work on Linux, Unix and
Mac OS X.

The emulation of the bsdsocket.library API is not complete, but should
be sufficient to allow you to use most popular AmigaOS network
clients, such as web browsers and mail readers.

To enable the bsdsocket.library emulation (assuming you are using a
version of E-UAE with this feature compiled in), add the option

bsdsocket_emu=true

to your config file.

Note that you do not need to install any real Amiga network stack - such
as AmiTCP or Miami - to be able to use the bsdsocket emulation.

Also note that when using the bsdsocket.library emulation that your
AmigaOS environment will use the same IP address as the host platform.
This may limit the types of networking software you can run in the
emulated Amiga environment. For example, Amiga software will not be
able to bind to ports already in use by host software, and your host
operating system may impose access controls on certain ranges of ports.

Older versions of E-UAE required that a bsdsocket.library wrapper file
be installed somewhere in the LIBS: path in your Amiga environment.
This is no longer the case, and this file should now be removed.
