Joystick port emulation
=======================

An Amiga has two joystick ports. Port 0 typically has a mouse attached to it
and port 1 may have a digital joystick, joypad or some other device
connected. E-UAE can emulate Amiga mice and joysticks using either input
from a physical mouse or joystick or by using specific key presses on the
keyboard to synthesize mouse and joystick movements or button clicks.

The device connected to port 0 can be configured with the joyport0=<mode>
configuration file option and the device at port 1 with joyport1=<mode>.
Additionally, some versions of E-UAE may supply a GUI controls to configure
the joystick.

Here <mode> can be one of:

none    - no device is connected to this port.

mouse   - a mouse will be emulated on this port using the host's default
          mouse (usually the device you use to move the mouse pointer on your
          desktop). Up to three mouse buttons are supported and a scroll
          wheel is currently supported when using E-UAE's X11 or SDL
          graphics drivers.

joy0    - a digital joystick will be emulated on this port using input from
          the first joystick detected on the host. This host device can be
          either a digital or analog joystick.

          Typically Amiga software supports up to three joystick fire buttons
          (although most games only require one or two) and these will be
          emulated by the first three fire buttons on the host joystick
          (additional buttons, if present, may be used when emulating a CD32
          controller - see below).

joy1    - a digital joystick will be emulated using the second host joystick.

joy<n>  - a digital joystick will be emulated using the <n-1>th host
          joystick.

kbd1    - a digital joystick is emulated using keys on the numeric keypad of
          the host keyboard, where:

          key pad 4 = joystick left
          key pad 6 = joystick right
          key pad 8 = joystick up
          key pad 2 = joystick down
          key pad 5 = joystick fire button 1

kbd2    - a digital joystick is emulated using the cursor keys and right Ctrl
          or right Alt key on the host keyboard, where:

          cursor left  = joystick left
          cursor right = joystick right
          cursor up    = joystick up
          cursor down  = joystick down
          right Ctrl   = joystick fire button 1
          right Alt    = joystick fire button 1

          Note that both the right Alt and right Ctrl keys produce fire
          button events since some keyboards (e.g. PC/USB keyboards on an
          Amiga, ADB Mac keyboards) don't produce unique events for right
          and left Ctrl and other keyboards (e.g Amiga keyboards and some
          laptop keyboards) don't even have a right Ctrl key.

kbd3    - a digital joystick is emulated using the following keys:

          F        = joystick left
          H        = joystick right
          T        = joystick up
          B        = joystick down
          left Alt = joystick fire button 1

Note that, when you employ any of the above keyboard-based joystick
emulations, the keys used by the joystick emulation are used exclusively for
joystick input - they will not produce normal key presses.


Emulating a CD32 controller
===========================

When emulating a CD32 (to do this, E-UAE must be booted with CD32 ROMs) the
joystick configured to port 1 may emulate a CD32 controller. The buttons on
the joystick will be mapped to CD32 controller buttons as follows:

          button 1  = CD32 Red (Fire/Select) button
          button 2  = CD32 Blue (Second fire/Stop) button
          button 3  = CD32 Yellow (Loop) button
          button 4  = CD32 Green (Shuffle) button
          button 5  = CD32 FFW button
          button 6  = CD32 RWD button
          button 7  = CD32 Play button
