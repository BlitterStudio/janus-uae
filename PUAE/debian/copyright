  P-UAE continues where E-UAE left off trying to sync to latest WinUAE.

  E-UAE is based on the work of dozens of contributors including Bernd Schmidt
  (the original author and maintainer of UAE), Bernie Meyer (the author of the
  x86 JIT compiler), Toni Wilen (the current maintainer of WinUAE), and many
  more.
